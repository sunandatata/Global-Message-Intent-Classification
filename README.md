# Global-Message-Intent-Classification
Objective:
This project focuses on the development of a message classification system that automatically detects the intent behind global messages. By utilizing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the goal is to classify messages into predefined categories such as sentiment, toxicity, and multilingual characteristics, enabling better automated responses and insights into user interactions.

Project Flow:
Data Preprocessing:

Import and clean the necessary libraries for NLP and machine learning tasks (e.g., pyicu, pycld2, transformers, TensorFlow).

Remove noise from the dataset (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal) to prepare the text data for analysis.

Handle multilingual data by detecting the language of the input text using libraries like polyglot and langdetect.

Feature Engineering:

Use TfidfVectorizer and other feature extraction techniques to transform the raw text data into numerical features.

Perform dimensionality reduction (PCA) to reduce the complexity of the feature set and improve model performance.

Model Building:

Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., LSTM, GRU, CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras for text classification tasks.

Use techniques like Spatial Dropout and Dropout layers to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization.

Implement early stopping, model checkpointing, and learning rate adjustments to fine-tune the model.

Training and Evaluation:

Train the models on the dataset using a variety of optimization algorithms such as Adam.

Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy and ROC-AUC score to assess the effectiveness of the classifier.

Deployment and Testing:

Load the dataset, split it into training, validation, and testing sets.

Test the models against unseen data and report performance metrics.

Use libraries like Googletrans for real-time translation and NLP enhancements in multilingual scenarios.

Final Insights:

Analyze results and produce visualizations using Plotly and Seaborn to gain insights into the classification results.

Visualize the most frequent terms in each category to understand key features driving the classification decisions.
